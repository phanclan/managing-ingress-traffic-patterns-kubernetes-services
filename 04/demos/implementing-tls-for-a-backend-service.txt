This exercise assumes a working Kubernetes cluster running on a public cloud
platform (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure). After the cluster has been created, deploy an
ingress controller, such as the community provided nginx ingress controller
(https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/). Ensure you have a domain
name associated with the provisioned ingress controller. The cluster used in
the demonstration in the course, was provisioned using kops - details here;
https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/custom-cloud/kops/.


Exercise: IMPLEMENTING TLS FOR A BACKEND SERVICE
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1.  Having created the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command, and make a
    mental note of the version for the server component.

$ kubectl version --short

2.  For convenience, define an environment variable for the current version of
    cert-manager

export REPO=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack/cert-manager

3.  As a prelude to deploying cert-manager to the cluster, create a namespace
    for it to reside in.

$ kubectl create namespace cert-manager

4.  Disable resource validation on the cert-manager namespace so cert-manager
    can provision certificates for its validating webhook

$ kubectl label namespace \
      cert-manager certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true

5.  Install cert-manager's custom resource definition resources

$ kubectl apply -f ${REPO}/release-0.6/deploy/manifests/00-crds.yaml

6.  Deploy cert-manager to the cluster. If the version of Kubernetes obtained
    from step 1 is < 1.12, append '--validate=false' to the command (as shown)

$ kubectl apply -f ${REPO}/release-0.6/deploy/manifests/cert-manager.yaml \
      --validate=false

7.  Verify the installation of cert-manager by listing the pods in the
    cert-manager namespace. It should list a pod for cert-manager, one for the
    webhook, and a completed pod for the webhook-ca-sync cronjob.

$ kubectl get po -n cert-manager


8.  Deploy an example workload, and expose it using a Service object of type
    ClusterIP.

$ kubectl apply -f nginxhello/nginxhello-blue.yaml

9.  Configure an ingress and host rule for your domain name, to route traffic
    to the deployed workload using the backend service from the previous step.
    Specify the 'tls' field to reference a secret that cert-manager will
    subsequently create.

$ vim ingress-scenarios/host-rule-with-tls-ingress.yaml

10. Apply the ingress definition to the cluster.

$ kubectl apply -f ingress-scenarios/host-rule-with-tls-ingress.yaml

11. Acquaint yourself with the Issuer definition that represents the Let's
    Encrypt ACME staging server (in the directory 'cert-manager'). Provide a
    suitable email address in the definition.

$ vim cert-manager/acme-letsencrypt-staging.yaml

12. Create the Issuer described in the YAML definition.

$ kubectl apply -f cert-manager/acme-letsencrypt-staging.yaml

13. Verify the successful creation of the Issuer object by describing it. Check
    an account has been successfully registered on the Let's Encrypt ACME
    server, as reported in the status.

$ kubectl describe issuer acme-letsencrypt-staging

14. Acquaint yourself with the Certificate definition that represents the
    certificate request. Configure the manifest for a domain name that you own
    and control.

$ vim cert-manager/certificate.yaml

15. For you to see the ACME challenge in progress, the next two steps need to
    be executed in quick succession, so read ahead to step 16 before executing
    step 15. Apply the definition of the certificate request.

$ kubectl apply -f cert-manager/certificate.yaml

16. Once the certificate object has been created, cert-manager will be subject
    to an ACME challenge. An Ingress object will be created for a temporary
    service that fulfils the challenge. Describe the challenge ingress using
    TAB completion. Note the rule for your host, and the path for the ACME
    challenge.

$ kubectl describe ing cm<TAB>

17. Check to make sure the certificate has been created as expected. Don't
    forget to replace the name of the certificate with the name you used in
    the manifest.

$ kubectl get cert <name>

18. Describe the certificate, and pay particular attention to the 'Status', and
    the 'Events' recorded during its acquisition. Again, remember to specify
    the correct name.

$ kubectl describe cert <name>

19. Check to make sure that the secret defined in the certificate has been
    created with the secret name specified in the Certificate object.

$ kubectl get secret <name>

20. Again, using the correct secret name, describe the secret and notice the
    annotations cert-manager has applied. Check that the secret contains a
    private key (tls.key) and a certificate (tls.crt).

$ kubectl describe secret <name>

21. Using a web browser, navigate to your domain name and confirm that the
    certificate that cert-manager has supplied is not valid. Inspect the
    certificate and notice that it is a fake certificate supplied by the Let's
    Encrypt staging ACME server.

22. Before attempting to access the real Let's Encrypt ACME server, delete the
    fake certificate using the correct name.

$ kubectl delete cert <name>

23. The secret also needs to be deleted before you attempt to acquire a genuine
    certificate. It will be re-created by cert-manager.

$ kubectl delete secret <name>

24. Copy the manifest describing the staging ACME server for Let's Encrypt, and
    name the file acme-letsencrypt-production.yaml.

$ cp cert-manager/acme-letsencrypt-staging.yaml \
      cert-manager/acme-letsencrypt-production.yaml

25. Change the name of the Issuer and the privateKeySecretRef, by simply
    substituting 'staging' for 'production'. Also remove 'staging' from the URL
    of the ACME server.

$ vim cert-manager/acme-letsencrypt-production.yaml

26. Apply the manifest to create the Issuer that represents the real Let's
    Encrypt ACME server.

$ kubectl apply -f cert-manager/acme-letsencrypt-production.yaml

27. Open the file containg the ingress manifest, and add an annotation to the
    ingress - 'certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: acme-letsencrypt-production.

$ vim ingress-scenarios/host-rule-ingress.yaml

28. Apply the updated ingress definition to the cluster.

$ kubectl apply -f ingress-scenarios/host-rule-ingress.yaml


29. Using a web browser, navigate to your domain name and confirm that the
    certificate that cert-manager has supplied is now a valid certificate.
